            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>India is a Union of States, as defined in Article 1 of the Indian Constitution. This signifies a strong and indissoluble bond between the center and the states. Unlike a federation where states can potentially secede, the Indian Union ensures a strong and united nation.</p>

            <h2>Key Features of the Union</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>**Indissolubility:** 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Union of India is a permanent entity. No state can unilaterally secede from the Union.</li>
                        <li>The Constitution emphasizes the unity and integrity of India.</li>
                        <li>**Example:** The formation of new states within India requires a constitutional amendment process, highlighting the indissoluble nature of the Union.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>**Strong Center:** 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Constitution grants significant powers to the Union government in areas crucial for national security, defense, foreign affairs, and economic development.</li>
                        <li>This reflects the need for a strong central authority to address national challenges and maintain national unity.</li>
                        <li>**Example:** The Union government has exclusive powers over defense, foreign affairs, and currency, ensuring a unified national response to external threats and economic policies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>**Two-tier Government:**
                    <ul>
                        <li>India has a federal system with two levels of government: the Union government and the state governments.</li>
                        <li>Both levels of government have their own powers and responsibilities, ensuring a balance of power and autonomy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>**Three-fold Division of Powers:**
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Constitution divides powers between the Union and the states through three lists:
                            <ul>
                                <li>**Union List:** Contains 97 subjects under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government. 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>**Example:** Defense, foreign affairs, currency, banking, atomic energy.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>**State List:** Contains 61 subjects under the exclusive jurisdiction of state governments.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>**Example:** Law and order, police, public health, education, agriculture.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>**Concurrent List:** Contains 52 subjects on which both the Union and state governments can legislate.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>**Example:** Education, marriage, forest, trade unions.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>In case of conflict between Union and state laws on a concurrent subject, the Union law prevails.</li>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
