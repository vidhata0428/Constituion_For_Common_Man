      <p>
        India, referred to as Bharat, shall be constituted as a Union of States as per Article 1 of the Indian Constitution. The territorial demarcations and divisions of the various States are defined in the First Schedule of the Constitution.

      <h2 style="color: var(--main-color);">Article 2 of the Indian Constitution</h2>
      <p>
        Article 2 addresses the creation or admission of new States. New States that meet certain criteria may be established or admitted into the Union by law. Before presenting a measure to the Parliament for consideration, the President would consult the concerned State Legislature if the bill has an impact on the name or boundary of a State.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Article 2 of the Indian Constitution, the Parliament may construct new states or admit states into the union on the terms and conditions it sees proper. The country’s international borders may change as a result of this article.
      </p>

        Additionally, this article does not establish a basis for how the state’s nature is gained. However, it stipulates that the government should follow the same structure as the rest of the nation. Under the terms of this article, Sikkim became a state of the union in 1975.

      <p>
        This article deals with matters related to the formation of new States, alteration of State areas, and the renaming of existing States. The procedure for implementing such changes involves several steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the President must recommend a Bill to either House of Parliament to introduce the proposed modifications. If the Bill affects the boundary or name of a State, the President will refer it to the concerned State Legislature for their opinion before its introduction in Parliament.

      </p>

        Additionally, the law may include supplemental, incidental, and consequential provisions deemed necessary by Parliament. It clarifies that such a law making changes to existing States or creating new States will not be considered an amendment to the Constitution.
